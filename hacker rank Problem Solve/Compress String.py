In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools . To read more about this function, Check this out .

You are given a string . Suppose a character '' occurs consecutively  times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character '' with  in the string.

For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.

Input Format

A single line of input consisting of the string .

Output Format

A single line of output consisting of the modified string.

Constraints

All the characters of  denote integers between  and .


Sample Input

1222311
Sample Output

(1, 1) (3, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1)
Explanation

First, the character  occurs only once. It is replaced by . Then the character  occurs three times, and it is replaced by  and so on.

Also, note the single space within each compression and between the compressions.

# Solution
from itertools import groupby

# Read the input string
input_string = input().strip()

# Use groupby to group consecutive characters
result = [(len(list(group)), key) for key, group in groupby(input_string)]

# Print the result in the required format
print(" ".join(f"({count}, {key})" for count, key in result))
